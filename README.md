# Online Garage Sale

This app creates an easy way to find and sell garage sale clothing items in your neighborhood. It includes filtering capabilities so users do not need to shift through long lists of items to find a good deal on an item perfect for their needs.

To post an item for sale, users will need to click “sell” and fill out the information on the form. All fields are required except for an item description to ensure full information is available for users looking to purchase an item. A unique posting ID will be generated upon submission of the form. 

To find an item for purchase, users can go to the “buy” page and filter postings for the items they are interested in and the distance they may have to travel to obtain the item. Once an item is found, users can click on the item and obtain information for contacting the seller to arrange a purchase. By going to the “manage” page, sellers can delete their posted items using their unique ID when their items are sold.
